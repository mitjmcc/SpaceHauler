Over here!
Thank you for choosing to direct operation Bit.Spike.
Welcome to our base of operations!
Let's see if your Director kit is functioning.
For starters, note the holomap in front of you.
This allows you to see Bit's location.
To scroll the holomap, use the touchpad on your remote.
<ScrollMap>
Looks like the holomap is working properly.
To show Bit where to go, use the laser pointer on your remote.
To activate the laser pointer, press the trigger.
<MoveBit>
Great! Bit received your directions with zero latency.
Bit has two pistols, which make short work of enemies.
You can switch to Bit's view at any time.
To switch to Bit's view, press the grip button.
<FirstPerson>
Check! Your director kit systems are nominal.
Keep in mind that when you switch to Bit's view,
you will be facing the direction Bit is facing.
You can see this in the LIVE FEED on the screen beside mine.
Got it? Let's try those guns out on the targets ahead.
<Targets>
Good shooting!
With your help, we will clear out those bots in no time.
When you're ready for a real mission, touch the computer console.
