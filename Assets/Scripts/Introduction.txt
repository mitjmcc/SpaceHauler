Alright, Driver. Turn to your right.
Hey, sunshine, welcome back to the Shooting Star,
the fastest 'Hauler this side of the Andromeda.

I can't seem to detect if you are new or just rusty.
Either way, let's run through the ship controls.

You'll want to use the WASD keys for movement:
"W" will move you upward, while "S" will move you downward.
"A" will strafe the ship left and "D" to the right.
And that's pretty much it!
Just press any button to get going, get to the end of the WARP Tunnel and remember to avoid those asteroids!
